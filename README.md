## Usage & Details 
A nearly identical copy of Etsy. This multivendor marketplace was built as practice for modelling and querying a database, as well as grasping how an ecommerce store may function on the backend. 

* Users are able to search for products based on a term. This search is case-insensitive
* As a user/site-visitor i'm able to view the products of a given user
* As a user/site-visitor i'm able to view all products for a given tag
* As a user i'm able to add a product to my store
* As a user i'm able to edit or remove a product from my store
