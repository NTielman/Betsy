# Betsy Marketplace
***

Hello winc instructor(s). 
Hope you're having an awesome day. I turned the Betsy assignment into an eccomerce store. 
*(Really wanted to challenge myself with querying and connecting the database to a front end)*. 
To help you grade my assignment I made you a quick video, showing how you can test if the database meets the assignment requiremnts.

edit: also i just want to give credit to <https://github.com/SteinOveHelset>, his tutorial "how to make a multi-vendor ecommerce store using Django" was of invaluable help for making Betsy.
